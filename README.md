## Weekly Homework Assignments

To reinforce learning, the course includes four weekly homework assignments. Each homework builds on the topics covered in the lectures and involves creating a small project or adding features to an existing one. The tasks are designed to be practical and will gradually lead students toward the skills needed for the final project. Below are the homework descriptions, requirements, and grading rubrics:

### Week 1 Homework: **Basic AI Text Responder**

#### Task Description:
Build a simple Spring Boot application that exposes an API for generating text using OpenAI. This homework focuses on getting comfortable with the OpenAI API calls from a Spring application (covering content from Lectures 1 and 2). You will create an endpoint that accepts a prompt from the user and returns a completion or answer generated by an OpenAI model. Essentially, you’re implementing a rudimentary “text responder” service that could serve as the backbone for chat or content generation features.

#### Requirements:
- **Spring Boot Service:** Set up a Spring Boot project (if not continuing from the lecture project) and include the Spring AI module or necessary HTTP client to call OpenAI.
- **API Endpoint:** Implement a REST endpoint (e.g., `POST /generate`) that accepts a JSON payload or form data containing a prompt or question.
- **OpenAI Integration:** Upon receiving a request, use the OpenAI API to generate a text completion. You can use either the Completions API or the ChatCompletion API in single-turn mode. For instance, if a user provides a prompt "Tell me a fun fact about Spring Boot", your service should return a fun fact as produced by the model.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Allow configuration of model settings via application properties or environment (at least model name and possibly temperature). For example, by default use `gpt-3.5-turbo` with a certain max tokens limit.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle errors such as missing prompt input, API request failures, or invalid API key. Return appropriate HTTP error codes/messages so the client knows what went wrong.
- **Logging:** Log the incoming prompt and the AI’s response (but avoid logging sensitive info) for debugging purposes.

#### Grading Rubric:
- **Correctness (70%)** – The API functions as specified: it accepts input and returns an AI-generated response correctly. All core features are implemented (calling OpenAI and returning the result). The response should be relevant to the prompt provided. Error conditions (like empty prompt or API failure) are handled with meaningful responses.
- **Efficiency (30%)** – The solution uses resources wisely. The OpenAI API is called only when needed (no redundant calls or excessive loops). The design is simple and avoids unnecessary overhead (like making multiple API calls when one would suffice). Use of Spring frameworks (like making the call using a single bean/service) is done cleanly to avoid performance bottlenecks. Additionally, if large prompts are sent, they’re handled (maybe truncated or refused with a message) rather than causing memory issues.

_Instructor comments:_ This assignment ensures students can do the basics – it’s essentially a test of setting up everything correctly and making a successful API call. Efficiency here is mainly about not doing anything obviously wasteful. We expect a straightforward implementation, but one that correctly follows Spring practices and handles the basic edge cases.
